            "While draining, simply stack the molds on each other, then reverse the order and turn the cheese frequently, while draining. During this time the curd can drop down to room temperature.",
            "Move the cheese to a cooler space overnight to allow the lactose conversion to finish. Cover with a loose open drain cloth. At the end of the make day the cheese has an acid of pH 5.4-5.3 but by next morning this has dropped to pH of 4.7-4.8.",
            "The next morning the cheese should have formed well and most of the lactose converted to lactic acid. Now its time for the salting prep for long storage in a light brine.",
            "Begin by cutting the basket rounds into half circles as shown in the pics above. If you formed these as a block then cut to 4 cube but they are harder to fit in a round pail for storage.",
            "Next measure out about 5% of cheese weight in salt. My 4 Gal cheese finished at about 5lbs 10oz, 5% of that shows that about 4.5oz of a medium grain salt are needed for the salting. It is always best to add salt by cheese weight.",
            "For dry salting the room should be about 60-65F. Either following method can be used: Lay the cut pieces of cheese out on a drain cloth for salting and cover with cloth or Place the curds in layers in the 1 gallon Pail and add the salt as each layer is placed. Use Parchment paper between layers of cheese to keep the pieces from sticking together",
            "Use half of the salt for each salting and the other half should be added the next day after turning the cheese.",
            "After the second day the pieces can be rinsed clean of any slime (yeast etc) and the salty whey poured off and they will be ready for aging in brine.",
            "An 8% brine with balanced acidity and calcium amounts is needed for aging. If the calcium is not added to the brine then the brine will leach the calcium out of the cheese until there is equilibrium between the two.",
            "Make up the brine so that you will have extra to top up the storage container as you remove cheese over the next weeks to months",
            "Use a one gallon (or more) container for storage. Polyethylene (opaque ones) or Polycarbonate (clear ones) will work along with sealing lids. Make sure the internal diameter of the container is a bit bigger than the diameter of the cheese forms because they will swell. For larger batches the bigger square tubs might be good. Just make sure they are large enough to allow for the Feta to be totally submersed below the liquid level, otherwise mold will grow near the surface.",
            "Place the cheese in layers into the storage container. Cut Parchment pieces to go between the layers to keep from sticking. Parchment will hold up in the brine and can even be used again. Don't use paper or plastic.",
            "Make sure that the Feta is well below the top leaving an inch or more below the brine level. Fill the container with brine leaving enough room at top for a weight. Use a flat disc as a weight (a small plate will also do) as the cheese tends to float. A small Zip Lock bag filled with enough brine to sink the cheese works well too.",
            "Seal the lid and place this in a cool room 50-60F for at least 3-4 weeks. This cheese will improve for many months and get better as the cheese changes during ripening."

            "Next, make the brine. I use a mix of water, white vinegar, sugar, and salt. If you're not a sweet pickle person, don't worry! The sugar doesn't actually make the refrigerator pickles sweet. Instead, it balances the pungent vinegar and salt to create an irresistible sour pickle flavor. Heat the brine on the stove until the sugar and salt dissolve and pour it over the jarred cucumbers. Then, set the jars aside to cool to room temperature.",

Dill pickle chips will be ready in 24 hours, while spears will take at least 48. They'll keep in the fridge for several weeks, and they get better as time goes on. For the best flavor, wait about 5 days.",

            "Start by rinsing the fish under cold water to remove any residual scales or blood. If the mackerel hasn't been gutted, make a shallow cut along the belly from the head to the tail, then remove the entrails and rinse the cavity thoroughly. Pat the fish dry with paper towels to ensure a crispy finish when cooking. Depending on your recipe, you can leave the mackerel whole, fillet it by cutting along the backbone and removing the bones, or portion it into steaks. For added flavour, you might marinate or season the fish with spices and oils before cooking.",
            "For grilling, preheat your grill to medium-high heat and place the seasoned mackerel directly on the grates. Grill for about 4-5 minutes per side, ensuring a crispy skin and tender, juicy flesh.",
            "Alternatively, preheat your oven to 200C, place the seasoned mackerel on a baking sheet, and roast for 20 minutes, turning halfway through.",
            "Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Rinse the mackerel under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season the inside of each fish with salt, pepper, and minced garlic. Place a few lemon slices and herbs inside each cavity",

            "Place the mackerel on the grill. Grill for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until the skin is crispy and the flesh flakes easily with a fork",
            "Remove from the grill and serve",
            "To store leftover mackerel, first ensure it has cooled to room temperature after cooking. Place the mackerel in an airtight container or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminium foil to prevent it from drying out and to protect it from absorbing other odours in the fridge. Store in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.",
            "If you wish to keep it for a longer period, you can freeze the mackerel. Wrap it well in plastic wrap or aluminium foil, and then place in a freezer-safe bag or container, removing as much air as possible to prevent freezer burn. Frozen mackerel can last up to 2 months. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then warm it up in the oven or on the stove."

You will know it is finished with its bulk ferment when the dough has risen about 75% (just short of doubling) in size, is smooth and puffy on top, with a few bubbles around the edges. It will not be as jiggly as some sourdough you've made before. I find this takes between 5-7 hours, depending on the temperature of your home.

The dough will now go through its final rise. You can do this on the counter, which will take about 1 1/2 to 2 hours at 70 degrees F for the dough to puff up and be jiggly. It will not double. OR you can do the final rise overnight in the refrigerator, with the banneton covered in a plastic bag or with a very damp cloth. You need this for holding moisture in.",

Using your hands, mix everything until it comes together into a shaggy mass. Continue to stretch and fold the dough over itself in the bowl to build strength, it will transform from sticky and shaggy to smooth and elastic over the course of 4-5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a container for bulk fermentation and cover.",

When your dough is fully proofed, place the steaming pan into the oven and your dough pan on a rack above. Spray several times into the oven chamber with a handheld spray bottle and close the oven door. Drop the oven temp to 425F (218C) and bake for 20 minutes with steam. After 20 minutes, remove the steaming pan and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes at 425F (218C). After that, when the dough looks well colored on top and the interior temp registers around 205F (96C), remove the loaf from its pan and finish baking in the oven directly on the oven rack for 5 minutes for more color. Finally, remove the loaf from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 3-4 hours before slicing."

Fold one short side of the dough into the middle and then fold the other short side on top. Then fold the dough in half the other direction. Dust lightly with flour, gently cover with the kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest for 5 minutes. While you are waiting, lightly flour a banneton basket or crumple a square piece of parchment paper, flatten it out again and line a medium sized bowl with it.

Cover and place on the counter next to the stove for 20 minutes for the second rise. To test if the dough is ready, press, do not poke, the tip of one floured finger quickly and lightly, about half an inch, slightly off center, into the crown of the dough. If the indentation remains but springs back slightly, the dough is ready for the oven. If the dent fills in, give the dough another 5-10 minutes to rise and re-test.",

            "Leftover rice works perfectly for fried rice, so if you have some hanging out in your fridge, use it here. But, if you don't have any, never fear: I've found a 2-step technique to make freshly cooked rice absolutely perfect for fried rice. The first step of making any rice dish is to adequately clean your rice. Some people like to do this in the pot they're going to cook their rice in, but I like to use a mesh strainer. Rinse the rice\u2014moving around the grains frequently\u2014until the water comes out clean.",
            "Once your rice is ready, you're going to par-boil the rice for just a few minutes. This will help to jumpstart the cooking process, breaking down the outsides of the grains of rice.",
            "Once you strain the rice, we're ready to make an impromptu steamer with a pot and a strainer that fits inside of it. First, add some water to the bottom of the pot, then put the strainer filled with your rinsed rice in it. Next, you're going to want to create some holes in the rice with chopsticks to allow steam to circulate.",
            "After making your holes, cover the pot with tin foil; it doesn't have to be totally snug, but it should be well-tented. Then, cover with the pot lid and let it steam. Steaming the rice is a gentler cooking process that keeps the grains pretty dry and adds less moisture to the rice, which is what we're looking for.",
            "After about 15 minutes, check on your rice: It should almost taste al-dente. What I mean by this is that it should be fully cooked through, but should taste drier than normal steamed rice. Once it's ready, I like to spread my rice on a sheet pan. This is a bit of overkill, but it will help your rice to cool down more quickly (which means fried rice faster!).",
            "Now that our rice is ready, let's focus on bringing everything together. A wok is the most traditional way to cook fried rice, and it does work especially well. The movement and centralized heat are very helpful, and its size holds a large amount of rice . But if you don't have one, don't let that stop you: I've made incredible fried rice in a cast iron skillet.",
            "Barely beat the eggs together (if you prefer some whites in your egg) before adding to your wok. Once you add to the wok, move your eggs around quickly, pressing in with a spatula to make those perfect fried rice egg squiggles. Once they're ready, take them out, and give your wok a quick wipe down. I recommend pre-cooking your eggs because if they sit in the fried rice for awhile, they will get overcooked.",
            "Next, it's time to add your oil. Don't be shy here: This is fried rice after all, so add enough to coat all of the grains in the oil. Add in your ginger and garlic: This will help flavor the oil which will transfer to your entire dish. Then, add the green onions and cook until softened, flipping and stirring frequently to prevent any burning.",
            "Add all of your rice, tossing and stirring it constantly (I mean it!). You should see the grains start to become individual, which is the tell-tale sign of a well-done fried rice. Once you see that the rice is separating, it's time to add your seasonings and soy sauce.",
            "Once your rice is perfectly seasoned and separated, it's time to add in your eggs and peas. Toss everything together, and serve once everything is well combined. \ufeffFinish with the green onion garnish, and get ready to dig into this takeout classic. \ufeff"

When the red chillies have changed to a deep red colour (takes only a few seconds), add the curry leaves. As the curry leaves pop immediately, move away from the pan as soon as you add the curry leaves. Remove from heat. Add this seasoning to the curry and close the lid immediately. Closing the lid ensures that all those delicious flavours are captured into the curry. Open after 5 minutes and give it a good stir.",

Place the flattened bread onto a floured plate and rub some flour over it. Then cover with a damp tea towel. Repeat with the rest of the breads.",
            "Frying the frybread: Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan on medium-high heat, making sure that it's about 1\u00bd cm (\u00bd an inch) high. Double line a plate with kitchen paper to soak up excess oil, and set aside. When the oil is shimmering, drop in a tiny piece of dough. If it comes up immediately, you know the oil is hot enough. Flip your pile of frybreads over, so we will start with the first one we rolled out. Pick the bread up, dust off excess flour by transferring it from hand to hand a couple of times, then slowly slip it into the hot oil. It will begin to puff up immediately. Cook for 1 minute, then flip over to the other side. Cook until a golden brown colour, then lift and place on the paper lined plate.",
            "Taco Meat: Chop up the onion. Heat the oil on medium heat and fry the onion for 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the mince. Brown the mince for 2 minutes, breaking it up with a spatula. Tip in the taco seasoning ingredients and fry for 30 seconds. Add the sundried tomato paste and stir to mix. Add the water and mix well. Cook on low heat for 10 minutes, until the water is all gone and you have a dry mix. Finish off with the black pepper.",
            "Cinnamon Sugar: Mix the sugar and cinnamon together.",
            "Serving Up: If making Indian taco, just pile the frybread with the meat, followed by the taco topping of your choice: cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. If having it sweet, just sprinkle as much of the cinnamon sugar as you fancy."

Rub the stem all over with the cut side of one of the lemon segments to prevent browning.",

            "Steam the artichoke: Fill a large pot with 1 inch of water, and squeeze in any remaining lemon juice. Add the squeezed lemon segments to the pot. Place a steamer basket in the pot, add the artichoke, and bring to a boil. Cover and steam for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the artichoke stem is fork-tender and you can easily peel off the outer leaves.",

            "Begin by heating the milk to 88-90F (32C). You do this by placing the milk in a pot or sink of very warm water. If you do this in a pot on the stove, make sure you heat the milk slowly and stir it well as it heats.",
            "Once the milk is at the proper temperature, the culture, 1/32 tsp Geotrichum Candidum, and 1/32 tsp Bacteria Linens can be added. To prevent the powder from caking and sinking in clumps, sprinkle the powder over the surface of the milk and then allow about 2 minutes for the powder to re-hydrate before stirring it in. The optional annatto and calcium chloride can also be added at this point.",
            "Once the cultures and other additions are added, allow the milk to ripen at this temperature for 30 minutes.",
            "Once the milk has been ripened fully, add about 1/2 tsp (2.5ml) of single strength liquid rennet.",
            "The milk now needs to set quietly for 45-60 minutes while the culture works and the rennet coagulates the curd. The thermal mass of this milk should keep it warm during this period. It should be kept at the proper temperature during this time.",
            "Once a firm curd has been formed (if still too soft, allow it to rest another 15 minutes) it is time to cut the curds and release the whey. The cutting needs to be slow and steady and the curd size should be about 1/2-5/8 inch in size. Here, I use a whisk with wires I have expanded but you can use a knife for the vertical cuts and a long spoon to complete the horizontal cuts.",
            "After the cut is complete, the curds should be stirred very slowly, so as not to break them for another 15 minutes.",
            "The curd now needs to be scalded to about 92F very slowly over 5-10 minutes and then further stirred for another 15-20 minutes until the final firmness is achieved.",
            "When this point is reached, the curds can be allowed to settle under the whey and the whey ladled off, leaving the curd mass and a little whey covering it in the bottom of the vat.",
            "The curds can now be transferred with the remaining whey directly to the sanitized molds placed on draining mats.",
            "As soon as all of the curd is transferred to the molds, another draining mat is placed on top and the form is turned with the draining mats to keep the curd mass contained.",
            "No press or weight is needed because we are making a high moisture cheese.",
            "The whey will continue to drain and the curds will settle in the molds as seen in the photos above. The culture is still producing acid, therefore it is important to keep them warm at 72-78F during this period. Allow this draining and acid production to continue until the next morning (about 14-18 hours in the molds). The forms can be removed and the cheese will be about 11.25-1.5 inches in height. They are now ready for salting.",
            "The cheese now needs to be set in the brine for about 1.5 hours.",
            "Flip the cheese and re-salt the surface about half way through the brine period.",
            "At the end of the brine bath, wipe the surface BUT DO NOT allow the cheese surface to dry (as in many other cheeses post brining) because we want a very high moisture during aging.",
            "Once the cheese is salted and dried of surface moisture, it needs to go into a plastic covered box to hold a high moisture level of about 95% and initially a temperature of 58-62F (higher than most other aging temps).",
            "Now, for the next 3-4 days, there is nothing to do but wait and turn the cheese once daily while the salt penetrates the curd and the cheese surface changes to a slippery surface caused by natural yeast picked up during sitting and handling to this point.",
            "You begin by making a light brine with about a cup of water and a good tablespoon of salt . If you want a more aromatic surface add about 1/32 tsp of the B.linens to this.",
            "Next the cheese are moistened daily to keep them hydrated and then wiped/brushed with the light brine 2-3 times during the first 7-10 days.",
            "Following this they need to be kept cooler at 40-50F to allow a slow but steady ripening of the cheese body. Too high a temp will cause the cheese to ripen unevenly.",
            "Continue to maintain the higher moisture to keep from drying out. If the surface becomes too dry, it can be moistened with a damp cloth. Wrapping the cheese with our washed rind papers will help to preserve the moisture at this point",
            "The final aging time will really depend on your 'Bravery' factor and what you want in the final cheese."

Tips for Making Spaghettieis Chill your potato ricer. Make sure to put the potato ricer (or spaetzle press) in the freezer at least one hour before assembly. This prevents the ice cream from melting and maintains the shape of the noodles. Choose the right setting. Use the smallest setting on the ricer so that you get perfectly thin spaghetti shapes. Practice your technique. The trickiest part of making this sundae is getting the consistency of the ice cream right. It needs to be soft enough to squeeze through the ricer but not so soft that it doesn&#39;t hold its shape. Start with a test scoop to see if your ice cream needs to rest at room temperature for five minutes before you can start extruding. Use the best berries. This sundae uses a fresh strawberry sauce, so make sure to get the ripest strawberries you can for maximum flavor. Once made, keep the sauce as cold as possible so it doesn&#39;t melt the ice cream. Save some freezer space. If you want to save space in your freezer, pipe the whipped cream dollops onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. They can be peeled off of the parchment once frozen and then placed into chilled ice cream bowls."
