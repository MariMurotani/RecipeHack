Tips for Making Spaghettieis Chill your potato ricer. Make sure to put the potato ricer (or spaetzle press) in the freezer at least one hour before assembly. This prevents the ice cream from melting and maintains the shape of the noodles. Choose the right setting. Use the smallest setting on the ricer so that you get perfectly thin spaghetti shapes. Practice your technique. The trickiest part of making this sundae is getting the consistency of the ice cream right. It needs to be soft enough to squeeze through the ricer but not so soft that it doesn&#39;t hold its shape. Start with a test scoop to see if your ice cream needs to rest at room temperature for five minutes before you can start extruding. Use the best berries. This sundae uses a fresh strawberry sauce, so make sure to get the ripest strawberries you can for maximum flavor. Once made, keep the sauce as cold as possible so it doesn&#39;t melt the ice cream. Save some freezer space. If you want to save space in your freezer, pipe the whipped cream dollops onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. They can be peeled off of the parchment once frozen and then placed into chilled ice cream bowls."
